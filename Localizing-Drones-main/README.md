Here is a repository that has all the research for the project that focuses on localizing drones using a single audio signal as part of 2021 BitCamp.

To get this running here is the recommened steps to take:
1. Download the files:
  The three files you need are "Localizing_Drones.ipynb" "ml_features.mat" and "ground_truth_angles.mat". 
  "ml_features.mat" is too big to upload to github so you can use that link to go to a folder on google drive and download it there.
2. Run the notebook cell by cell.
3. profit

Its still pretty raw but the premise can be found in a presentation that is also in the google drive link.
